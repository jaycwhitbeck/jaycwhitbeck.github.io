		<h1>Jamie Whitbeck – Professional Portfolio</h1>

		<p>
			Welcome to my project portfolio. I have nearly a decade of experience in data management, analysis, SQL engineering, ETL design, and database administration. This curated selection of technical write-ups—from both professional
			and personal projects—highlights how I think, build, and troubleshoot. Each project includes a detailed write-up. Where practical, I have included screenshots or actual code samples. Where necessary, redactions were made to
			maintain client security and confidentiality.
		</p>

		<p>This collection is a work in progress, as I only recently began documenting my work for public consumption. I will continue updating the portfolio as more projects are written up.</p>
		<div>All titles are clickable links.</div>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<div class="entry">
			<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/main/docs/JamieWhitbeck_CareerTrajectory.pdf", target="_blank">Career Trajectory</a>
			<div>I often have a habit of underselling myself so as not to brag. This is not one of those times.</div>
			<div>This is where I drop the humility and tell the truth: I’ve built things, solved problems, and saved systems from slow, painful deaths.</div>
			<div>If you want receipts, I brought plenty.</div>
		</div>

		<h2>Selected Projects</h2>

		<div class="entry">
			<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/main/docs/JamieWhitbeck_Python_CaseStudy_DocumentStore.pdf", target="_blank">Document Storage Application</a>
			<p>
				A fun personal project and Python GUI learning exercise. A friend needed a local, searchable database for storing scraped text—no web apps, no cloud, no fuss. I built a standalone SQLite-backed desktop application with a
				full GUI that handled input, classification, search, and display far beyond what he expected. He will never lose his documentation on canning squirrels and proper roadkill preparation again.
			</p>

		<div class="entry">
			<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/main/docs/JamieWhitbeck_SQL_CaseStudy_ListPagination.pdf", target="_blank">Mobile Application List Pagination Procedure</a>
			<p>
				While supporting development of a mobile CMMS app as the Lead SQL Developer, I was asked to optimize a stored procedure used for paginating item lists. Execution times averaged 27 seconds—clearly unacceptable. I discovered
				the developer planned to replicate this procedure over 300 times, once per module. I immediately saw the impending development and maintenance nightmares. I designed a single, dynamic, parameterized procedure that eliminated
				the redundancy and slashed execution times to under 20 milliseconds—a 99.94% improvement.
			</p>

		<div class="entry">
			<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/main/docs/JamieWhitbeck_SaaSDatabaseMigrationTool.pdf", target="_blank">Scripted SaaS Database Migration</a>
			<p>
				Most companies brace for all-nighters and prayer circles when it's time to migrate or consolidate SQL environments. I wrote a reusable stored procedure, deployed it to our container registration database, and successfully
				migrated more than 500 databases across three legacy servers to a single SSD-powered instance in under 1 hour. With automation, linked servers, testing, and full logging, the average impact was less than 10 seconds per
				tenant.

		<div class="entry">
			<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/main/docs/JamieWhitbeck_SQL_CaseStudy_Encryption.pdf", target="_blank">User Data Encryption</a>
			<p>
				As the DBA for a CMMS vendor with over 1,000 tenant databases and thousands of on-premises clients, I discovered that the "encryption" used for user credentials was laughably insecure—especially considering some clients were
				government agencies, hospitals, and critical infrastructure organizations, many of which used our GIS module to map their assets. I built a robust, standards-compliant solution to secure all credentials, resolving a gaping
				vulnerability before it became a real incident.

		<h2>Selected Awards</h2>

		<div class="entry">
			<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/main/docs/JamieWhitbeck_MFInnovatorAward.pdf", target="_blank">Innovator Award</a>
			<p>
				I was honored to receive the Innovator Award at Musician’s Friend for my proactive and innovative approach to reporting and problem-solving for the Inventory Planning department. The full text of the speech given at the
				awards ceremony can be found at the above link.
