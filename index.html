  <h1>Jamie Whitbeck – Development Project Portfolio</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my project portfolio. I have nearly a decade of experience in data management, analysis, SQL engineering, ETL design, and database administration. This curated selection of technical write-ups—from both professional and personal projects—highlights how I think, build, and troubleshoot. Each project includes a detailed write-up. Where practical, I have included screenshots or actual code samples. Where necessary, redactions were made to maintain client security and confidentiality.</p>

  <p>This collection is a work in progress, as I only recently began documenting my work for public consumption. I will continue updating the portfolio as more projects are written up.</p>

  <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
  <div class="subtitle">(Project titles link to PDF write-ups)</div>

  <div class="project">
    <a href="https://github.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/blob/main/JamieWhitbeck_ReportingEvolution.pdf">Data Analysis and Reporting Evolution</a>
    <p>This traces my transformation from inheriting a manual, error-prone reporting process to developing automated, scalable data solution. From Excel and VBA tools to OLTP queries, SSRS reports, and ETL-driven data stores, it highlights my drive for continuous improvement and real business impact. Along the way, I tackled legacy systems, complex integrations, and built sustainable reporting—never settling for “just good enough.”</p>

  <div class="project">
    <a href="https://github.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/blob/main/JamieWhitbeck_Python_CaseStudy_DocumentStore.pdf">Document Storage Application</a>
    <p>A fun personal project and Python GUI learning exercise. A friend needed a local, searchable database for storing scraped text—no web apps, no cloud, no fuss. I built a standalone SQLite-backed desktop application with a full GUI that handled input, classification, search, and display far beyond what he expected. He will never lose his documentation on canning squirrels and proper roadkill preparation again.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <a href="https://github.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/blob/main/JamieWhitbeck_SQL_CaseStudy_ListPagination.pdf">Mobile Application List Pagination Procedure</a>
    <p>While supporting development of a mobile CMMS app as the Lead SQL Developer, I was asked to optimize a stored procedure used for paginating item lists. Execution times averaged 27 seconds—clearly unacceptable. I discovered the developer planned to replicate this procedure over 300 times, once per module. Given that some servers housed over 500 databases, I immediately saw the maintenance nightmare this would create. I designed a single, dynamic, parameterized procedure that eliminated the redundancy and slashed execution times to under 20 milliseconds—a 99.94% improvement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <a href="https://github.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/blob/main/JamieWhitbeck_SaaSDatabaseMigrationTool.pdf">Scripted SaaS Database Migration</a>
    <p>Most companies brace for all-nighters and prayer circles when it's time to migrate or consolidate SQL environments. I wrote a reusable stored procedure, deployed it to our container registration database, and successfully migrated more than 500 databases across three legacy servers to a single SSD-powered instance in under 1 hour. With automation, linked servers, testing, and full logging, the average impact was less than 10 seconds per tenant.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <a href="https://github.com/jaycwhitbeck/jaycwhitbeck.github.io/blob/main/JamieWhitbeck_SQL_CaseStudy_Encryption.pdf">User Data Encryption</a>
    <p>As the DBA for a CMMS vendor with over 1,000 tenant databases and thousands of on-premises clients, I discovered that the "encryption" used for user credentials was laughably insecure—especially considering some clients were government agencies, hospitals, and critical infrastructure organizations, many of which used our GIS module to map their assets. I built a robust, standards-compliant solution to secure all credentials, resolving a gaping vulnerability before it became a real incident.</p>
